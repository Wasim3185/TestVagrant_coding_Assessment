I have made this project using java programming language.
This code will provide you the filtered teams based on the n consecutive wins/losses of a particular team.
And then, will find the average points of filtered teams.
If you want to run this code on command prompt, which I recommend you to do, then please follow this procedure:
1. Save this code on Desktop with name CricketIPLTeam.
2. Open command prompt, then write "cd Desktop".
3. If you are storing the code in some folder then you have to write "cd Folder-name", only if you are storing the code in some folder otherwise just follow the next steps.
4. Then write "javac CricketIPLTeam.java" to compile the program, you need to compile it only once.
5. Then write "java CricketIPLTeam" to execute the program.
6. You need to enter "java CricketIPLTeam" everytime to execute this program in command prompt.
7. You can also use other java programming applications to execute this program, if you want to.
8. After the program has been executed, you have to enter in which type you want to filter the teams, means either you want to filter them according to the number of consecutive losses or wins. According to problem given to solve, we need to retrieve the teams that have 2 consecutive losses. So please enter "loss" in the input.
9. And then click enter.
10. Then, you have to enter the value of "n", that is the number of consecutive losses or wins to filter the data, so please enter the number: 2.
11. And after that just click enter again.
12. In results, you will get the names of filtered teams that have 2 consecutive losses and the avearge points of these filtered teams.
